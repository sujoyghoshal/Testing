# Testing
This repository contains an Express.js RESTful API that serves data from a JSON file. Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, the API provides endpoints to retrieve all records (GET /all) or a specific record by id (GET /all/:id). The application handles basic errors related to file operations and is designed for easy data access.
